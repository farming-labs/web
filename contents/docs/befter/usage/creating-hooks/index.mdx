# Usage Documentation for Befter

## Introduction

Befter is a simple and effective JavaScript library for managing hooks in your applications. It provides a way to add hooks to specific labels and manage them efficiently, allowing you to execute, update, and remove hooks dynamically. Befter also supports `before` and `after` hooks, enabling more complex workflows.

## Core APIs and Usage

### Creating befter

`createBefter()`

#### Definition

The `createBefter` function is used to create a new hook manager. It returns an object that can hold various hooks associated with labels.

### Hook Options

The `HookOptions` interface allows customization of the hook system within `createBefter`, including execution behavior, storage type, and Redis configuration.

```typescript
type HookFunctionRunner = "serial" | "parallel";

interface HookOptions {
  afterRunner?: HookFunctionRunner;
  beforeRunner?: HookFunctionRunner;
  runner?: HookFunctionRunner;
  storage?: Storage;
}

interface Storage {
  type: "local" | "redis";
  url?: string;
  client?: RedisClient; // or any client that we support refer to client section
}
```

- **`afterRunner`** – Defines how `after` hooks run (`"serial"` or `"parallel"`).
- **`beforeRunner`** – Defines how `before` hooks run (`"serial"` or `"parallel"`).
- **`runner`** – Controls execution mode for all hooks unless overridden (`"serial"` or `"parallel"`).
- **`storage`** – Determines where hooks are stored with a type of (`"local"` for in-memory, `"redis"` for Redis storage) and url or client if any type is other than local which somehow needs a client.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { createBefter, hook, callHook } from "@farming-labs/befter";
const hooks = createBefter({});
```

- **Arguments**: None. - No options
- **Returns**: An object representing the hook manager.

#### Storage Options

Befter supports the following storage options:

- **Local**: Stores hooks in-memory, suitable for single-instance applications and illustrated on above examples.
- **Redis**: Stores hooks in a Redis database, enabling distributed hook execution across multiple instances

#### Real-World Example

In a larger application, you would call `createBefter()` to initialize your hook manager:

```javascript
// Using Redis storage
import { createBefter, hook } from "@farming-labs/befter";
import { createClient } from "redis";

// using redis locally
const redisClient = createClient({ url: "redis://localhost:6379" });
await redisClient.connect();

// Initialize the hook manager
const hooks = createBefter({
  storage: {
    type: "redis",
    url: "redis://localhost:6379",
    client: redisClient,
  },
});

await hook(hooks, "hook1", () => console.log("This is a Redis hook"));
```

```javascript
// Initialize the hook manager
const hooks = createBefter();
```

### Hooking a function

`hook(hooks, label, fn)`

#### Definition

The `hook` function allows you to associate a hook function with a specific label. This function will be stored in the hook manager, and you can call it later. Befter supports multiple storage backends, including Redis, enabling distributed hook management.

#### Usage

```javascript
const { currHook, removeHook } = await hook(hooks, "hook1", () =>
  console.log("This is a hook"),
);
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): A label to associate with the hook.
  - `fn` (Function): The function to be executed when the hook is called.
    - This could also be an array of `fn` (function) to be excuted serially by default but could be parallel based on your config. See here.
- **Returns**: An object containing:
  - `currHook`: The current list of functions for the specified label.
  - `removeHook`: A function used to remove a specific hook.

#### Real-World Example

Imagine you need to handle form submission and want to execute hooks before and after the form is submitted:

```javascript
const hooks = createBefter();

// Add a hook for form submission
hook(hooks, "formSubmit", () => console.log("Form submitted!"));
```

But for redis, we have to `await` the response since we are gonna make async call to the storage server.

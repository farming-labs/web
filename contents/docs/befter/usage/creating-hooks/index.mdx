# Usage Documentation for Befter

## Introduction

Befter is a simple and effective JavaScript library for managing hooks in your applications. It provides a way to add hooks to specific labels and manage them efficiently, allowing you to execute, update, and remove hooks dynamically. Befter also supports `before` and `after` hooks, enabling more complex workflows.

## Core APIs and Usage

### 1. `createBefter()`

#### Definition

The `createBefter` function is used to create a new hook manager. It returns an object that can hold various hooks associated with labels.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { createBefter, hook, callHook } from "@farming-labs/befter";
const hooks = createBefter();
```

- **Arguments**: None.
- **Returns**: An object representing the hook manager.

#### Real-World Example

In a larger application, you would call `createBefter()` to initialize your hook manager:

```javascript
// Initialize the hook manager
const hooks = createBefter();
```

### 2. `hook(hooks, label, fn)`

#### Definition

The `hook` function allows you to associate a hook function with a specific label. This function will be stored in the hook manager, and you can call it later.

#### Usage

```javascript
const { currHook, removeHook } = hook(hooks, 'hook1', () => console.log('This is a hook'));
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): A label to associate with the hook.
  - `fn` (Function): The function to be executed when the hook is called.

- **Returns**: An object containing:
  - `currHook`: The current list of functions for the specified label.
  - `removeHook`: A function used to remove a specific hook.

#### Real-World Example

Imagine you need to handle form submission and want to execute hooks before and after the form is submitted:

```javascript
const hooks = createBefter();

// Add a hook for form submission
hook(hooks, 'formSubmit', () => console.log('Form submitted!'));
```

### Remove Hook

`removeHook(hooks, label, hookFunction)`

#### Definition

The `removeHook` function removes a specific hook from a given label. You must specify which function to remove.

#### Usage

```javascript
await removeHook(hooks, "hook1", hook1[0]);
```

- **Arguments**:

  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be removed.
  - `hookFunction` (Function): The hook function to be removed.

- **Returns**: The removed function.

#### Real-World Example

You may want to remove a specific hook after it has been executed:

```javascript
// Add a hook
const { currHook, removeHook } = hook(hooks, "hook1", () =>
  console.log("This is a hook"),
);

// Call the hook
await callHook(hooks, "hook1");

// Remove the hook after calling it
await removeHook(hooks, "hook1", currHook["hook1"][0]);
```

This will remove the first hook of `hook1` and prevent it from being called again.

### Remove Hook Itself

`removeHookItSelf(hooks, label)`

#### Definition

The `removeHookItSelf` function removes all hooks associated with the given label.

#### Usage

```javascript
await removeHookItSelf(hooks, "hook1");
```

- **Arguments**:

  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be removed.

- **Returns**: The updated hook manager object.

#### Real-World Example

In a scenario where a hook should only run once, you can remove it after execution:

```javascript
// Add a hook for logging in
await hook(hooks, "login", () => console.log("Logging in..."));

// Call the hook
await callHook(hooks, "login");

// Remove the hook after it is called
await removeHookItSelf(hooks, "login");
```
